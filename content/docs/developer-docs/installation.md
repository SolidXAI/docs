#  Installing SolidX

Installing `SolidX` is a breeze with our [`solidctl create-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@solidxai/solidctl) workflow.  

<Callout type="info" title="Mental Model">

  Installing SolidX is really a <strong>project bootstrap</strong> step, not just a package installation step.
  - <strong><code>create-app</code></strong> scaffolds a new SolidX application workspace.
    - That workspace includes both <code>solid-api</code> and <code>solid-ui</code>.
    - You then build the project, seed metadata, and start development from there.
  So the intuition is: <strong>you are creating a working SolidX project skeleton</strong>, not merely adding a dependency to an existing folder.

</Callout>

##  Quick Overview
- Run the command below to initialize your SolidX project:  

  ```bash
  npx @solidxai/solidctl@latest create-app
  ```

- Answer a few simple prompts to configure your project.
- This scaffolds a new project with both backend and frontend applications.
- After scaffolding, the usual next steps are to build the project and seed metadata.
- Customize SolidX to fit your needs!
